#NexusUI AJAX/PHP Demo

*NOTES:* This repo is being prepared, and the *examples* in /examples do not work. For a working demo, use index.html and receiver.maxpat.

Step 1: Host this folder on an Apache (or other) server.

Step 2: Open index.html in a browser (must be on /localhost/) and receiver.maxpat in Max (and turn on the DAC).

Step 3: Interact with the index.html website -- this template sends OSC via a PHP script (in /lib) to Max over UDP port 7475.

Step 4: Modify and make something musical!
